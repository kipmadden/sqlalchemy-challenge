    "# SQLAlchemy Hawaiian weather analysis - Surfs Up!\n",
    "\n",
    "I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with my trip planning, I did some climate analysis on the area. Using using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib on a SQLite database with two tables containing meterological data several aspects of weather were studied.  \n",
